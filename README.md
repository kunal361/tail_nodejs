#tail -f like function in node.js

This problem requires you to implement a log watching solution (similar to the tail -f command in UNIX). However, in this case, the log file is hosted on a remote machine.

You have to implement the following:

1. A server side program to monitor the given log file and capable of streaming updates that happen in it. This will run on the same machine as the log file.

2. A web based client (accessible via URL like http://localhost/log) that prints the updates in the file as when they happen and NOT upon page refresh. The page should be loaded once and it should keep getting updated in real-time. 

The server should not retransmit the entire file every time. It should only send the updates.

You can not use off-the-shelf libraries that provide tail-like functionalities.


#Working

Execute the server in the terminal:</br>
> node server.js

This will start serving the log file on localhost on port 8000.
